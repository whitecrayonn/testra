## Summary

- **Fully implemented end-to-end:** None. Even the most complete flows (Identity, Test Case Management) lack production hardening.
- **Backend functional, frontend missing:** API Keys, Test Folders, Test Suites, Automation Ingestion, Audit.
- **Frontend functional, backend partial:** Dashboard, Settings shell.
- **Not started:** Defects, API Testing, Billing, Analytics, Intelligence, Integration Hub, SSO, Marketplace, Public SDK. **Notifications are implemented.**
- **Blockers for production:** rate limiting, API-key auth, SSE auth, route guards, secrets management, K8s/Terraform completion, and deployment pipeline.
